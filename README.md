## Features
A user-friendly database interface created to be connected to the Olympic Archery database, which stores data from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Connected to MySQL Database Management System through Python connector, this interface is capable to perform the INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW and ALTER SQL commands as well as retrieve data by using basic to intermediate QUERY commands.
